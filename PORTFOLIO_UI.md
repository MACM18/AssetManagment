## Security

All portfolio operations require authentication:

- User must be signed in to access `/portfolio`
- Holdings scoped to user UID
- Firestore rules enforce user isolation
- Client-side auth checks before API calls

## Real-time Calculations

Portfolio metrics calculated on-the-fly:

- Fetch current stock prices
- Match with user holdings
- Calculate gain/loss per holding
- Aggregate totals
- Update percentage returns

**Formula:**

```
Invested = Quantity × Purchase Price
Current Value = Quantity × Current Price
Gain/Loss = Current Value - Invested
Gain/Loss % = (Gain/Loss / Invested) × 100
```

## Integration Points

- **AuthContext**: User authentication state
- **PortfolioContext**: Portfolio data and refresh
- **tradingData**: Current stock prices
- **portfolio lib**: CRUD operations
- **Firestore**: Data persistence

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

Phase 4 will add advanced analytics:

- Performance charts over time
- Sector/diversification analysis
- Stock-specific insights
- Comparison with market indices
- Historical performance tracking

## Usage Example

export default function PortfolioPage() {
  return <PortfolioDashboard />;
}
```
