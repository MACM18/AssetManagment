2. Stock data saved to Firestore `stock_prices` collection
3. Trading platform queries Firestore for latest/historical data
4. Components render data with charts and visualizations
5. Auto-refresh keeps data current

### Performance

- Build time: ~19 seconds
- Bundle size: 334 KB (First Load JS)
- Static export for fast deployment
- Efficient Firestore queries with indexing

## Build Status

âœ… **Build Successful**

- No TypeScript errors
- No critical ESLint warnings
- Static export generated
- All components compiled

## Future Roadmap

2. Implement price alerts
3. Add export to CSV functionality
4. Dark mode support

### Medium Term

1. Real-time WebSocket updates
